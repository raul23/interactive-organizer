About
=====
Interactively and manually organize ebook files quickly. It is a very interesting script developed originally by `na-- <https://github.com/na-->`_
since you can manually check the files that were automatically renamed by `organized_ebooks <https://github.com/raul23/organize-ebooks>`_
directly in the terminal. Many useful operations can be performed through the terminal for each ebook that you want to check:

- read the file content (text conversion) from the terminal by leveraging the ``less`` command
- read the book's metadata from the corresponding ``.meta`` file
- provide the correct ISBN and the file will be renamed by fetching metadata from online sources
- and so on!

This is a Python port of `interactive-organizer.sh <https://github.com/na--/ebook-tools/blob/master/interactive-organizer.sh>`_ 
from `ebook-tools <https://github.com/na--/ebook-tools>`_ written in shell by `na-- <https://github.com/na-->`_.

Personally, this is the shell script from ``na--`` that I had the most fun porting* to Python since it shows the powerful and interesting
things you can do through the terminal and all via a Python script: you can even invoke a bash shell directly from the python script and then go 
back to the Python script as if nothing happened! 

What I also like is how ``na--`` had the great idea of highlighting the differences in the old
filename compared to the new one for a given renamed ebook. Similar words between both filenames are colored green and those missing
in the new filename are colored red. Hence you can quickly see if the file was renamed correctly.

\* all ``na--`` shell scripts were a lot of fun to port but this one really is special since you interact more with it than the others

`:star:` Other related Python projects based on ``ebook-tools``:

   - `convert-to-txt <https://github.com/raul23/convert-to-txt>`_: convert documents (pdf, djvu, epub, word) to txt
   - `find-isbns <https://github.com/raul23/find-isbns>`_: find ISBNs from ebooks (pdf, djvu, epub) or any string given as input to the script
   - `ocr <https://github.com/raul23/ocr>`_: run OCR on documents (pdf, djvu, and images)
   - `split-ebooks-into-folders <https://github.com/raul23/split-ebooks-into-folders>`_: split the supplied ebook files into 
     folders with consecutive names
   - `organize-ebooks <https://github.com/raul23/organize-ebooks>`_: automatically organize folders with potentially huge amounts of 
     unorganized ebooks. It leverages the first three previous Python scripts.

Dependencies
============
`:warning:` 

   You can ignore this section and go straight to pulling the `Docker image <#installing-with-docker-recommended>`_ which contains all the 
   required dependencies and the Python package ``interactive_organizer`` already installed. This section is more for showing how I setup my system
   when porting the shell script `interactive-organizer.sh <https://github.com/na--/ebook-tools/blob/master/interactive-organizer.sh>`_ et al. 
   to Python.

This is the environment on which the Python package `interactive_organizer <./interactive_organizer/y>`_ was developed and tested:

* **Platform:** macOS
* **Python**: version **3.7**
